# World-Economic-Indiactor-



The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is creating a
department under its name which will focus on how a country can attain sustainable
growth. This organisation hires you as a data analyst for this department to
determine which factors a country should focus on to sustain GDP/ Capita.
Now, they provide you with the dataset ( World Economic Indicator Dataset), which
has different countries' and regions' GDPs, populations, and other factors that might
impact GDP/Capita. Now using Data Analysis methods, develop a solution that can
be referred to as "how a country can attain sustainable growth".

Gross domestic product (GDP) is the total monetary or market value of all the
finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a specific period,
usually one financial year.
- GDP provides a scorecard for a country’s Economic Health.
- GDP can be calculated in 3 ways using Expenditure, Production or income.
- The GDP ratio to the region's total population is the per capita GDP, and the
same is called the Mean Standard of Living.
